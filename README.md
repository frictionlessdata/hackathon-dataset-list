# Welcome to team Dataset List!

Our main goal is to create a website that lists all the datapackages on GitHub. We'll build the site using [Frictionless Livemark](https://livemark.frictionlessdata.io/).

## Goals (see [issues](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/hackathon-dataset-list/issues) for each task)
- Create a site using Livemark
- Query/search GitHub to find datapackages
- List the results on the new website
- Ensure that the search happens on a regular basis so the information is up to date
- Style the website so it matches other Frictionless sites

## Skills needed
- Writing code in Python
- Project planning/status updates
- Design for the site
- Knowledge of how to search/query GitHub
- Knowledge of GitHub's API?
- ...?
